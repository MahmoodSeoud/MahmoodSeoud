## About Me

I'm a 22-year-old computer science student at KU at 5<sup>th</sup>, with a keen interest in technology, sports (especially gym workouts), and finance. While pursuing my studies, I developed a fascination for machine learning and AI. I'm also contemplating becoming a part-time firefighter or personal trainer in the future, as I'm torn between these two passions. Currently, I'm employed at PeopleNet, a small IT company based in Copenhagen.

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm engrossed in a fascinating project: a handwritten digit recognizer. For this project, I utilize TensorFlow to train my machine learning model, numpy for efficient data storage in NumPy arrays, and gradio to create an interactive visual interface. The implementation is done in Python, leveraging its powerful ecosystem for machine learning and AI.

Additionally, my friend [Nidocq](https://github.com/Nidocq) and I collaborated on an online platform called [ABD_DIS-Projekt](https://github.com/Nidocq/ABD_DIS-Projekt). It's a marketplace where users can sell their used items. We employed technologies such as React, TypeScript, and SQL for database management.

## My Tech Stack

I'm currently enamored with Python, particularly in the context of machine learning and AI. Exploring these fields has exposed me to the fascinating world of mathematical foundations. I also have considerable experience with TypeScript, which I find more enjoyable than plain JavaScript. At work, I primarily rely on React with TypeScript, but I'm comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as well.

## Open-Source Contributions

Though I haven't made any open-source contributions yet, I'm eagerly looking forward to contributing to the development of an open-source RISC-V manual. RISC-V is an assembly programming language that I find intriguing, and I'm excited to dive deeper into its internals.
