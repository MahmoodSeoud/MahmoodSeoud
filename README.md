### Hey Yo
Hey, I'm Mahmood! I'm a 24-year-old computer science student at ITU (MSc in Computer Science) with a strong interest in machine learning, AI, tech, sports (especially gym workouts), and finance. I currently work at [PeopleNet](https://peoplenet.dk/), a  consultant company in Copenhagen, and I'm also considering becoming a part-time firefighter or personal trainer.

## Recent Work
I recently completed my bachelor's thesis on creating a Bluetooth mesh grid network with an adaptive protocol. You can find the paper [here](https://easychair.org/publications/paper/Gv4N). 

I'm also working on **SysMentor**, a startup focused on making learning fun for Computer Systems students. Check out our landing page [here](https://abdsecondhand.site/LANDING/out/), and feel free to explore two interactive projects I co-created: [Cache-hit-miss](https://github.com/MahmoodSeoud/cache-hit-miss) and [VMAT](https://github.com/MahmoodSeoud/VMAT).

Additionally, I've teamed up with [Nidocq](https://github.com/Nidocq) on **ABD_DIS-Projekt**, an online marketplace built with React, TypeScript, and SQL. Check it out [here](https://github.com/Nidocq/ABD_DIS-Projekt).

## My Tech Stack

I'm passionate about Python, especially for machine learning, AI, and Networking, and also enjoy working with TypeScript. I use React with TypeScript at work but I am comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Open-Source Contributions
I'm excited to start contributing to open-source, with plans to dive into RISC-V, an assembly programming language that intrigues me.
